    "\n",
    "## Register Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Register Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intermediate code uses unlimited temporaries\n",
    "- Typical intermediate code uses too many temporaries\n",
    "- Problem \n",
    "    - Rewrite the intermediate code to use no more temporaries than there are machine registers.\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "    - Assign multiple temporaries to each register\n",
    "    - But without changing the program behavior\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "    - Source: `a = c + d; e = a + b; f = e - 1;`\n",
    "    - Target: `r1 = r2 + r3; r1 = r1 + r4; r1 = r1 - 1;`\n",
    "- Theorem\n",
    "    - Temporaries t1 and t2 can share the same register if at any point in the program at most one of t1 or t2 is live.\n",
    "    - If t1 and t2 are live at the same time, they cannot share a register.\n",
    "- Compute live variables for each point\n",
    "    - ![](Note_jpg/16-01-01.png)\n",
    "- Algo\n",
    "    - Construct an undirected graph.\n",
    "        - A node for each temporary.\n",
    "        - An edge between t1 and t2 if they are live simultaneously at some point in the program.\n",
    "    - This is the **register interference graph**(RIG)\n",
    "        - Two temporaries can be allocated to the same register if there is no edge connecting them\n",
    "- Sample\n",
    "    - ![](Note_jpg/16-01-02.png)\n",
    "    - `b` and `c` cannot be in the same register\n",
    "    - `b` and `d` could be in the same register\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Coloring\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coloring\n",
    "    - A **coloring of a graph** is an assignment of colors to nodes, such that nodes connected by an edge have different colors.\n",
    "    - A graph is **k-colorable** if it has a coloring with k colors.\n",
    "    - NP-Hard\n",
    "- RIG is a coloring problem.\n",
    "- Heuristic\n",
    "    1. Decide coloring orders\n",
    "        - Pick a node t with fewer than k neighbors\n",
    "        - Put t on a stack and remove it from the RIG\n",
    "        - Repeat until the graph is empty\n",
    "    2. Assign the color\n",
    "        - Start with the last node added\n",
    "        - At each step pick a color different from those assigned to already colored neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spilling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the graph coloring heuristic fails to find a coloring, then we canâ€™t hold all values in registers.\n",
    "    - Some values are spilled to memory.\n",
    "- What if all nodes have k or more neighbors?\n",
    "    - Pick a node as a candidate for spilling\n",
    "    - A spilled value **lives** in memory\n",
    "    - Assume f is chosen. Remove f and continue the simplification.\n",
    "- If optimistic coloring fails, we spill f.\n",
    "    - Allocate a memory location for f like `$fa`.\n",
    "    - Before each operation that reads f, insert `f = load fa`.\n",
    "    - After each operation that writes f, insert `store f, fa`.\n",
    "    - ![](Note_jpg/16-03-01.png)\n",
    "    - Note f has been split into three temporaries.\n",
    "- `fi` is live only\n",
    "    - Between a `fi = load fa` and the next instruction\n",
    "    - Between a `store fi, fa` and the preceding instr.\n",
    "- Spilling reduces the live range of `f`\n",
    "- Additional spills might be required before a coloring is found\n",
    "- The tricky part is deciding what to spill\n",
    "- Possible heuristics\n",
    "    - Spill temporaries with most conflicts\n",
    "    - Spill temporaries with few definitions and uses\n",
    "    - Avoid spilling in inner loops\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Register allocation is a **must have** in compilers\n",
    "    - Because intermediate code uses too many temporaries\n",
    "    - Because it makes a big difference in performance\n",
    "- Register allocation is more complicated for CISC machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Caches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compilers are very good at managing registers.\n",
    "- Compilers are not good at managing caches.\n",
    "    - This problem is still left to programmers.\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "    - Before: `for(j = 0 -> 9) for(i = 1 -> 10000) a[i] *= b[i];`\n",
    "    - After: `for(i = 1 -> 10000) for(j = 0 -> 9) a[i] *= b[i];`\n",
    "    - Might be more than 10x faster.\n",
    "- A compiler can perform this **loop interchange** optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Memory Management\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- C and C++ programs have many storage bugs\n",
    "    - forgetting to free unused memory\n",
    "    - dereferencing a dangling pointer\n",
    "    - overwriting parts of a data structure by accident\n",
    "- When an object is created, unused space is automatically allocated\n",
    "- Some space is occupied by objects that will never be used again\n",
    "    - This space can be freed to be reused later\n",
    "- An object x is reachable if and only if:\n",
    "    - a register contains a pointer to x, or\n",
    "    - another reachable object y contains a pointer to x\n",
    "- An unreachable object can never be used\n",
    "\n",
    "**Managing Memory in Cool**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses an accumulator\n",
    "    - it points to an object\n",
    "    - and this object may point to other objects, etc.\n",
    "- And a stack pointer\n",
    "    - each stack frame contains pointers, e.g., method parameters\n",
    "    - each stack frame also contains non-pointers, e.g., return address\n",
    "- Start tracing from acc and stack (roots)\n",
    "- Every garbage collection scheme has the following steps\n",
    "    1. Allocate space as needed for new objects\n",
    "    2. When space runs out:\n",
    "        1. Compute what objects might be used again (generally by tracing objects reachable from a set of **root** registers)\n",
    "        2. Free the space used by objects not found in (1)\n",
    "- Some strategies perform garbage collection before the space actually runs out.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mark and Sweep\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algo\n",
    "    - The **Mark** Phase: trace reachable objects\n",
    "    - The **Sweep** Phase: collect garbage objects\n",
    "- Every object has an extra bit: the **mark** bit\n",
    "    - Initial: 0\n",
    "    - Set to 1 for the reachable objects in the mark phase\n",
    "- Any garbage object is added to the free list\n",
    "- Objects with a mark bit 1 reset to 0\n",
    "- A serious problem with the mark phase\n",
    "    - it is invoked when we are out of space\n",
    "    - yet it needs space to construct the queue in the mark phase\n",
    "    - the size of the todo list is unbounded, so we cannot reserve space for it a priori\n",
    "- The todo list is used as an auxiliary data structure to perform the reachability analysis\n",
    "- There is a trick that allows the auxiliary data to be stored in the objects themselves\n",
    "- Space for a new object is allocated from the new list\n",
    "    - a block large enough is picked\n",
    "    - an area of the necessary size is allocated from it\n",
    "    - the left-over is put back in the free list\n",
    "- Mark and sweep can fragment the memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop and Copy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memory is organized into two areas\n",
    "    - old space: used for allocation\n",
    "    - new space: used as a reserve for GC\n",
    "- GC starts when the old space is full\n",
    "- Copies all reachable objects from old space into new space\n",
    "- After the copy the roles of the old and new spaces are reversed and the program resumes\n",
    "    - Use new space as old space; use old space as new space.\n",
    "- Find all the reachable objects: mark and sweep\n",
    "    - Fix pointers\n",
    "- Algo\n",
    "    1. Copy the objects pointed to by roots and set forwarding pointers\n",
    "    2. Follow the pointer in the next unscanned object (A)\n",
    "        - copy the pointed-to objects\n",
    "        - fix the pointer in A\n",
    "        - set forwarding pointer\n",
    "    3. Follow the pointer in the next unscanned object \n",
    "- Must be able to tell how large an object is when we scan it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conservative Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- GC relies on being able to find all reachable objects\n",
    "- In C or C++ it is impossible to identify the contents of objects in memory\n",
    "- But it is Ok to be conservative\n",
    "    - if a memory word looks like a pointer, it is considered a pointer\n",
    "        - it must be aligned\n",
    "        - it must point to a valid address in the data segment\n",
    "    - all such pointers are followed and we overestimate the set of reachable objects\n",
    "- But we still cannot move objects because we cannot update pointers to them\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try to collect an object when there are no more pointers to it\n",
    "- Store in each object the number of pointers to that object\n",
    "    - this is the reference count\n",
    "- Advantages\n",
    "    - easy to implement\n",
    "    - collects garbage incrementally without large pauses in the execution\n",
    "- Disadvantages\n",
    "    - cannot collect circular structures\n",
    "    - manipulating reference counts at each assignment is very slow\n",
    "- Automatic memory management prevents serious storage bugs\n",
    "- But reduces programmer control\n",
    "    - layout of data in memory\n",
    "    - when is memory deallocated\n",
    "- Pauses problematic in real-time applications\n",
    "- Memory leaks possible (even likely)\n",
    "- Garbage collection is very important\n",
    "- There are more advanced garbage collection algorithms\n",
    "    - concurrent: allow the program to run while the collection is happening\n",
    "    - generational: do not scan long-lived objects at every collection\n",
    "    - real time: bound the length of pauses\n",
    "    - parallel: several collectors working at once"
