    "\n",
    "## Semantic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lexical Analysis**: Detects inputs with **illegal tokens**.\n",
    "- **Parsing**: Detects inputs with **ill-formed parse trees**.\n",
    "- **Semantic Analysis**: **Catches all remaining errors**.\n",
    "- **Example**. (Cool)\n",
    "  1. All idenfifiers are declared\n",
    "  2. Types\n",
    "  3. Inheritance relationships\n",
    "  4. Classes defined only once\n",
    "  5. ...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- Matching identifier declarations with uses.\n",
    "- The scope of an identifier is the portion of a program in which that identifier is accessible.\n",
    "- The same identifier may refer to different things in different parts of the program.\n",
    "- Most languages have static scope.\n",
    "- A few languages are dynamically scoped.\n",
    "  - A dynamically-scoped variable refers to the closest enclosing binding in the execution of the program.\n",
    "- Cool identifier bindings are introduced by\n",
    "  - Class declarations (introduce class names)\n",
    "  - Method definitions (introduce method names)\n",
    "  - Let expressions (introduce object id’s)\n",
    "  - Formal parameters (introduce object id’s)\n",
    "  - Attribute definitions (introduce object id’s)\n",
    "  - Case expressions (introduce object id’s)\n",
    "- Not all identifiers follow the most-closely nested rule.\n",
    "  - Example. (class definitions in Cool)\n",
    "    - Are globally visible throughout the program.\n",
    "- Attribute names are global within the class in which they are defined.\n",
    "- Methods may also be redefined (overridden).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbol Table\n",
    "\n",
    "- Much of semantic analysis can be expressed as a recursive descent of an AST\n",
    "  - **Before**: Push the identifiers into symbol tables (stack).\n",
    "  - **In the Process**: Process the children of AST.\n",
    "  - **After**: Pop the identifier up from symbol tables (stack).\n",
    "  - Use a stack because there are identifier definitions with the same name.\n",
    "- **Symbol Table Operations**\n",
    "  - `add_symbol(x)`\n",
    "  - `find_symbol(x)`: ask type in semantics / memory location in cgen\n",
    "  - `remove_symbol(x)`\n",
    "  - `enter_scope()`\n",
    "  - `exit_scope()`\n",
    "  - `check_scope(x)`\n",
    "- Because class can be used before being defined, how to manage class?\n",
    "  - Solution: do 2 tree traversals.\n",
    "    - Pass 1: Gather all class names\n",
    "    - Pass 2: Do the type checking\n",
    "  - Actually, semantic analysis requires **multiple** passes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Type Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meaning: The notion varies in different languages.\n",
    "- Consensus\n",
    "  - A set of values\n",
    "  - A set of operations on those values\n",
    "- In assembly language level, there are no types. For `add $r1, $r2, $r3`, just add it bitwisely.\n",
    "- Same type, but not make sense.\n",
    "  - Function Pointer (int) + Number (int)\n",
    "- Type system in a language specifies which operations are valid for which types.\n",
    "- The goal of **type checking** is to ensure that operations are used only with the correct type.\n",
    "- Three kinds of languages\n",
    "  - Statically typed: All or almost all checking of types is done as part of compilation.\n",
    "  - Dynamically typed: Almost all checking of types is done as part of program execution.\n",
    "  - Untyped: No type checking.\n",
    "- Competing view\n",
    "  - Static Typing\n",
    "    - Static checking catches many programming errors at compile time.\n",
    "    - Avoids overhead of runtime type checks.\n",
    "  - Dynamic Typing\n",
    "    - Static type systems are restrictive.\n",
    "    - Rapid prototyping difficult within a static type system.\n",
    "- A lot of code is written in statically typed languages with an “escape” mechanism. Unsafe casts in C, Java.\n",
    "- People retrofit static typing to dynamically typed languages for optimization, debugging.\n",
    "- The compiler infers types for every expression.\n",
    "- Term.\n",
    "  - **Type Checking** is the process of verifying fully typed programs.\n",
    "  - **Type Inference** is the process of filling in missing type information.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Type Checking\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have seen two examples of formal notation specifying parts of a compiler.\n",
    "  - **Lexical Analysis**: Regular expressions\n",
    "  - **Parsing**: Context-free grammars\n",
    "  - **Type checking**: Logical rules of inference\n",
    "- **Inference Rules**\n",
    "  - Form: If **hypothesis** is true, then **Conclusion** is true.\n",
    "  - Type checking: If $E_1$ and $E_2$ have certain types, then $E_3$ has a certain type.\n",
    "  - Notation\n",
    "    - And: $\\wedge$\n",
    "    - If-Then: $\\Rightarrow$\n",
    "    - $x$ has type $T$: $x:T$\n",
    "    - It is provable that...: $\\vdash$\n",
    "- Example.\n",
    "  - If $e_1$ has type **Int** and $e_2$ has type **Int**, then $e_1+e_2$ has type **Int**.\n",
    "  - ($e_1$ has type **Int** $\\wedge$ $e_2$ has type **Int**) $\\Rightarrow$ $e_1+e_2$ has type **Int**.\n",
    "  - $(e_1:Int \\wedge e_2:Int) \\Rightarrow e_1+e_2:Int$\n",
    "  - $Hypothesis_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge Hypothesis_n \\Rightarrow Conclusion$\n",
    "- Tradition inference rules are writen by $$\\frac{\\vdash Hypothesis \\dots \\vdash Hypothesis}{\\vdash Conclusion}$$\n",
    "- Cool type rules: $\\vdash e:T$\n",
    "- Example.\n",
    "  - [Int] $$\\frac{i:Constant}{\\vdash i:Int}$$\n",
    "  - [Add] $$\\frac{\\vdash e_1:Int \\vdash e_2:Int}{\\vdash e_1+e_2:Int}$$\n",
    "  - [1+2] $$\\frac{\\frac{1:Constant}{\\vdash 1:Int}\\frac{2:Constant}{\\vdash 2:Int}}{\\vdash 1+2:Int}$$\n",
    "- A type system is **sound** if\n",
    "  - When $\\vdash e:T$, then $e$ evaluates to a value of type $T$.\n",
    "  - We only want sound rules and the more prescise one. $(\\vdash i:Int) > (\\vdash i:Object)$\n",
    "- Types are computed in a bottom-up pass over the AST.\n",
