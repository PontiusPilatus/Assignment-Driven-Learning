    "\n",
    "- A basic block is a maximal sequence of instructions with:\n",
    "    - no labels (except at the first instruction), and\n",
    "    - no jumps (except in the last instruction)\n",
    "- Idea:\n",
    "    - Cannot jump into a basic block (except at beginning)\n",
    "    - Cannot jump out of a basic block (except at end)\n",
    "    - A basic block is a single-entry, single-exit, straight-line code segment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control-flow Graph**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A control-flow graph is a directed graph with\n",
    "    - Basic blocks as nodes\n",
    "    - An edge from block A to block B if the execution can pass from the last instruction in A to the first instruction in B\n",
    "        - E.g., the last instruction in A is jump to B\n",
    "        - E.g., execution can fall-through from block A to block B\n",

    "**Remarks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimization seeks to improve a program's resource utilization\n",
    "    - Execution Time\n",
    "    - Code Size\n",
    "    - Network messages sent, etc.\n",

    "- Optimize one basic block\n",
    "- Some statements can be deleted\n",
    "    - `x = x + 0`\n",
    "    - `x = x * 1`\n",
    "- Rewrite code in **single assignment** form.\n",
    "    - Each register occurs only once on the left-hand side of an assignment.\n",
    "- Constant Folding: `c_1 op c_2`\n",
    "    - Operation on constants can be computed at compile time \n",
    "    - It can be dangerous. Cross-compiling on different archs differs from on the same arch.\n",
    "- Eliminate unreachable basic blocks from the initial block\n",
    "- Common Subexpression Elimination\n",
    "    - `x = y + z; w = y + z;` => `x = y + z; w = x;`\n",
    "    - If `w = x` appears, replace all `w` with `x`.\n",
    "- Dead Code Elimination\n",
    "    - If `w = xxxx;`, then `w` does not appear anywhere else.\n",
    "- Performing one optimization enables another\n",
    "    - Optimizing compilers repeat optimizations until no improvement is possible\n",
    "    - The optimizer can also be stopped at any point to limit compilation time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Peephole Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimizations can be directly applied to assembly code\n",
    "- Peephole optimization replaces the sequence with another equivalent one (but faster)\n",
    "- Example\n",
    "    - `move $a $b; move b a;` => `move $a $b;`\n",

    "- Global constant propagation can be performed at any point where ** holds\n",
    "- Consider the case of computing ** for a single variable X at all program points\n",
    "- To make the problem precise, we associate one of the following values with X at every program point\n",
    "    - $\\perp$: This statement never executes.\n",
    "    - c: `X` = constant c\n",
    "    - T; `X` is not a constant.\n",

    "**Transfer function**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The analysis of a complicated program can be expressed as a combination of simple rules relating the change in information between adjacent statements.\n",

    "- T is the greatest value, $\\perp$ is the least\n",
    "    - All constants are in between and incomparable\n",
    "- Let `lub` be the least-upper bound in this ordering\n",
    "    - Rules 1-4 can be written using lub: `C(s, x, in) = lub { C(p, x, out) | p is a predecessor of s }`\n",
    "- The use of lub explains why the algorithm terminates\n",
    "    - Values start as $\\perp$ and **only increase**\n",
    "    - $\\perp$ can change to a constant, and a constant to T\n",
    "    - Thus, C(s, x, in/out) can change at most twice\n",

    "\n",
    "- A variable `x` is **live** at statement s if\n",
    "    - There exists a statement `s`’ that uses `x`\n",
    "    - There is a path from `s` to `s’`\n",
    "    - That path has no intervening assignment to `x`\n",
    "- A statement `x = ...` is dead code if x is dead after the assignment\n",
    "    - Dead statements can be deleted from the program\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we evaluate the liveness**\n",

    "    1. Let all `L(...) = false` initially\n",
    "    2. Repeat until all statements s satisfy rules 1-4\n",
    "        - Pick s where one of 1-4 does not hold and update using the appropriate rule\n",
    "- A value can change from **false** to **true**, but not the other way around\n",
    "- Each value can change only once, so termination is guaranteed\n",
    "- Once the analysis is computed, it is simple to eliminate dead code\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two kinds of analysis:\n",
    "    - **Constant propagation** is a **forwards analysis**: information is pushed from inputs to outputs\n",
    "    - **Liveness** is a **backwards analysis**: information is pushed from outputs back towards inputs\n",
    "- There are many other global flow analyses\n",
    "- Most can be classified as either forward or backward\n",
    "- Most also follow the methodology of local rules relating information between adjacent program points"
