    "\n",
    "## What is **parsing**?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: To derive the parse tree of program in grammar.\n",
    "- **Input**: Sequence of tokens from lexer\n",
    "- **Output**: Parse tree of the program.\n",
    "- Sample\n",
    "    - Input: `IF ID = ID THEN INT ELSE INT FI`\n",
    "    - Output: `(IF-THEN-ELSE (= ID ID) (INT) (INT))`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context-Free Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: To separate the token string into many pieces such that every piece is acceptable in grammar.\n",
    "    - **Context-Free** means every two pieces are not related.\n",
    "    - Parser must distinguish between **valid** and **invalid** strings of tokens under CFGs.\n",
    "- **What we need**\n",
    "    - A language for **describing valid strings of tokens**.\n",
    "    - A method for distinguishing valid under the language.\n",
    "- **Note**: Programming languages always have recursive structures.\n",
    "    - An **EXPR** is ... (recursive)\n",
    "        - `if EXPR then EXPR else EXPR fi`\n",
    "    - Context-free grammars are a natural notation for this recursive structure.\n",
    "- **Def.** A CFG consists of\n",
    "    - A set of terminals $T$\n",
    "    - A set of non-terminals $N$\n",
    "    - A start symbol $S \\in N$\n",
    "    - A set of productions $X \\rightarrow Y_1, \\dots, Y_N, X\\in N, Y_i \\in N\\cup T\\cup \\{ \\epsilon\\}$\n",
    "        - Ex: $S\\rightarrow (S)$\n",
    "        - How the production works?\n",
    "            - Begin with a string with only the start symbol $S$\n",
    "            - Replace any non-terminal $X$ in the string by the right-hand side of some production $X \\rightarrow Y_1\\dots Y_n$\n",
    "            - Repeat (2) until there are no non-terminals\n",
    "                - $X_1\\dots X_i X X_{i+1}\\dots X_N \\rightarrow X_1\\dots X_i Y_1\\dots Y_k X_{i+1}\\dots X_N,\\ if\\ X\\rightarrow Y_1\\dots Y_k$\n",
    "                - $S \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow \\alpha_0 \\rightarrow \\alpha_1 \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow \\alpha_n, if\\ \\alpha_0 \\rightarrow^* \\alpha_n (\\geq 0\\ steps)$\n",
    "- **Def.** (Language) Use grammar to define language.\n",
    "    - Let $G$ be a context-free grammar with start symbol $S$. Then the language $L(G)$ of $G$ is $$\\{ a_1\\dots a_n\\ |\\ \\forall i\\ (a_i\\in T)\\wedge (S\\rightarrow^* a_1\\dots a_n) \\}$$\n",
    "    - Terminals ought to be tokens of the language.\n",
    "    - Membership in a language is **yes** or **no**; also need parse tree of the input.\n",
    "    - Must handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "    - Need an implementation of CFG’s (e.g., bison)\n",
    "    - Form of the grammar is important.\n",
    "        - Many grammars generate the same language.\n",
    "        - Tools are sensitive to the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derivations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: To define the process from the start symbol to some valid token string.\n",
    "    - Def. A **derivation** is a sequence of productions applying on a start symbol $S$ to sequences without any non-terminal.\n",
    "    - We can draw a derivation as a tree\n",
    "        - Start symbol is the tree’s root\n",
    "        - For a production $X \\rightarrow Y_1\\dots Y_n$ add children $Y_1\\dots Y_n$ to node $X$.\n",
    "    - Sample\n",
    "        - $G$: $E\\rightarrow E+E\\ |\\ E*E\\ |\\ (E)\\ |\\ id$\n",
    "        - Target: $id*id+id$\n",
    "        - Derivation: $E \\rightarrow E+E \\rightarrow E*E+E \\rightarrow id*E+E \\rightarrow id*id+E \\rightarrow id*id+id$\n",
    "        - Draw derivation as a parse tree: $(((id) * (id)) + (id))$\n",
    "        - The example is a **left-most** derivation. At each step, replace the left-most non-terminal.\n",
    "        - Note that right-most and left-most derivations have the same parse tree.\n",
    "- A parse tree has\n",
    "    - Terminals at the leaves\n",
    "    - Non-terminals at the interior nodes\n",
    "- An **in-order** traversal of the leaves is the original input.\n",
    "- We are not just interested in whether $s \\in L(G)$.\n",
    "    - We need a parse tree for $s$.\n",
    "- The relation between derivation and parse tree are many to one.\n",
    "    - `((id)+(id))`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: A parse tree is used to describe how we explain the program string. If there are two parse trees for the program, it has two meanings.\n",
    "- **Sample**\n",
    "    - $G$: $E\\rightarrow E+E\\ |\\ E*E\\ |\\ (E)\\ |\\ id$\n",
    "    - Target: $id*id+id$\n",
    "    - This string has two parse trees\n",
    "        - Derivation: $E \\rightarrow E+E \\rightarrow E*E+E \\rightarrow id*E+E \\rightarrow id*id+E \\rightarrow id*id+id$\n",
    "        - Derivation: $E \\rightarrow E*E \\rightarrow E*E+E \\rightarrow id*E+E \\rightarrow id*id+E \\rightarrow id*id+id$\n",
    "- Def. A grammar is **ambiguous**, if it has more than one parse tree for some string $s\\in L(G)$.\n",
    "    - A lot of ways to solve it.\n",
    "    - Most direct method is to rewrite grammar unambiguously.\n",
    "    - Like, enforces precedence of * over +.\n",
    "    - Impossible to convert **automatically** an ambiguous grammar to an unambiguous one.\n",
    "    - Most tools allow precedence and associativity declarations to disambiguate grammars.\n",

    "## Error\n",

    "### Error\n",

    "    - Not slow down compilation of valid code\n",
    "- **What to do**\n",
    "    1. Panic mode\n",
    "        - Discard tokens until one with a clear role is found. And continue.\n",
    "        - Bison: use the special terminal error to describe how much input to skip.\n",
    "    2. Error Productions\n",
    "        - Specify known common mistakes in the grammar, like `5x` and `5*x`...\n",
    "        - Complicates the grammar.\n",
    "    3. Automatic local or global correction\n",
    "        - Try token insertions and deletions. (Edit distance)\n",

    "        - From left to right\n",
    "    - Use DFS to match the token string\n",
    "        - Let the global pointer `next` point to the next input token: `TOKEN *next = array;`\n",
    "        - Try to match a given token terminal: `bool term(TOKEN tok) { return *next++ == tok; }`\n",
    "        - Try to mathc the $n^{th}$ production of S: `bool Sn() { ... }`\n",
    "        - For production $E\\rightarrow T$: `bool E1() { return T(); }`\n",
    "        - For production $E\\rightarrow T+E$: `bool E2() { return T() && term(PLUS) && E(); }`\n",

    "            bool E() { TOKEN *save = next; return (next = save, E1()) || (next = save, E2()); }```\n",
