    "### Static vs. Dynamic Typing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Static type systems detect common errors at compile time.\n",
    "- But some correct programs are disallowed.\n",
    "\t- Some argue for **dynamic type checking** instead.\n",
    "\t- Others want more **expressive static type checking**.\n",
    "- Def.\n",
    "\t- The **dynamic type** of an object is the class C that is used in the `new C` expression that created it at run-time.\n",
    "\t- The **static type** of an expression captures all dynamic types the expression could have at compile-time.\n",
