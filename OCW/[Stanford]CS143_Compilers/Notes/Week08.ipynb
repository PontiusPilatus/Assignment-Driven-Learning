    "\t- Rules 1-4 can be written using lub: `C(s, x, in) = lub { C(p, x, out) | p is a predecessor of s }`\n",
    "- The use of lub explains why the algorithm terminates\n",
    "\t- Values start as $\\perp$ and **only increase**\n",

    "- A value can change from **false** to **true**, but not the other way around\n",

    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two kinds of analysis:\n",
    "\t- **Constant propagation** is a **forwards analysis**: information is pushed from inputs to outputs\n",
    "\t- **Liveness** is a **backwards analysis**: information is pushed from outputs back towards inputs\n",
    "- There are many other global flow analyses\n",
    "- Most can be classified as either forward or backward\n",
    "- Most also follow the methodology of local rules relating information between adjacent program points"
