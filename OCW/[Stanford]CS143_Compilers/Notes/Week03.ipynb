    "## What is **parsing**?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: To derive the parse tree of program in grammar.\n",
    "- **Input**: Sequence of tokens from lexer\n",
    "- **Output**: Parse tree of the program.\n",
    "- Sample\n",
    "\t- Input: `IF ID = ID THEN INT ELSE INT FI`\n",
    "\t- Output: `(IF-THEN-ELSE (= ID ID) (INT) (INT))`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context-Free Grammars\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: To separate the token string into many pieces such that every piece is acceptable in grammar.\n",
    "\t- **Context-Free** means every two pieces are not related.\n",
    "\t- Parser must distinguish between **valid** and **invalid** strings of tokens under CFGs.\n",
    "- **What we need**\n",
    "\t- A language for **describing valid strings of tokens**.\n",
    "\t- A method for distinguishing valid under the language.\n",
    "- **Note**: Programming languages always have recursive structures.\n",
    "\t- An **EXPR** is ... (recursive)\n",
    "\t\t- `if EXPR then EXPR else EXPR fi`\n",
    "\t- Context-free grammars are a natural notation for this recursive structure.\n",
    "- **Def.** A CFG consists of\n",
    "\t- A set of terminals $T$\n",
    "\t- A set of non-terminals $N$\n",
    "\t- A start symbol $S \\in N$\n",
    "\t- A set of productions $X \\rightarrow Y_1, \\dots, Y_N, X\\in N, Y_i \\in N\\cup T\\cup \\{ \\epsilon\\}$\n",
    "\t\t- Ex: $S\\rightarrow (S)$\n",
    "\t\t- How the production works?\n",
    "\t\t\t- Begin with a string with only the start symbol $S$\n",
    "\t\t\t- Replace any non-terminal $X$ in the string by the right-hand side of some production $X \\rightarrow Y_1\\dots Y_n$\n",
    "\t\t\t- Repeat (2) until there are no non-terminals\n",
    "\t\t\t\t- $X_1\\dots X_i X X_{i+1}\\dots X_N \\rightarrow X_1\\dots X_i Y_1\\dots Y_k X_{i+1}\\dots X_N,\\ if\\ X\\rightarrow Y_1\\dots Y_k$\n",
    "\t\t\t\t- $S \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow \\alpha_0 \\rightarrow \\alpha_1 \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow \\alpha_n, if\\ \\alpha_0 \\rightarrow^* \\alpha_n (\\geq 0\\ steps)$\n",
    "- **Def.** (Language) Use grammar to define language.\n",
    "\t- Let $G$ be a context-free grammar with start symbol $S$. Then the language $L(G)$ of $G$ is $$\\{ a_1\\dots a_n\\ |\\ \\forall i\\ (a_i\\in T)\\wedge (S\\rightarrow^* a_1\\dots a_n) \\}$$\n",
    "\t- Terminals ought to be tokens of the language.\n",
    "\t- Membership in a language is **yes** or **no**; also need parse tree of the input.\n",
    "\t- Must handle errors gracefully.\n",
    "\t- Need an implementation of CFG’s (e.g., bison)\n",
    "\t- Form of the grammar is important.\n",
    "\t\t- Many grammars generate the same language.\n",
    "\t\t- Tools are sensitive to the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Derivations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: To define the process from the start symbol to some valid token string.\n",
    "\t- Def. A **derivation** is a sequence of productions applying on a start symbol $S$ to a sequences without any non-terminal.\n",
    "\t- We can draw a derivation as a tree\n",
    "\t\t- Start symbol is the tree’s root\n",
    "\t\t- For a production $X \\rightarrow Y_1\\dots Y_n$ add children $Y_1\\dots Y_n$ to node $X$.\n",
    "\t- Sample\n",
    "\t\t- $G$: $E\\rightarrow E+E\\ |\\ E*E\\ |\\ (E)\\ |\\ id$\n",

    "\t\t- Draw derivation as a parse tree: $(((id) * (id)) + (id))$\n",
    "\t\t- The example is a **left-most** derivation. At each step, replace the left-most non-terminal.\n",
    "\t\t- Note that right-most and left-most derivations have the same parse tree.\n",
    "- A parse tree has\n",
    "\t- Terminals at the leaves\n",
    "\t- Non-terminals at the interior nodes\n",
    "- An **in-order** traversal of the leaves is the original input.\n",
    "- We are not just interested in whether $s \\in L(G)$.\n",
    "\t- We need a parse tree for $s$.\n",
    "- The relation between derivation and parse tree are many to one.\n",
    "\t- `((id)+(id))`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal**: A parse tree is used to describe how we explain the program string. If there are two parse trees for the program, it has two meanings.\n",
    "- **Sample**\n",
    "\t- $G$: $E\\rightarrow E+E\\ |\\ E*E\\ |\\ (E)\\ |\\ id$\n",
    "\t- Target: $id*id+id$\n",

    "- Def. A grammar is **ambiguous**, if it has more than one parse tree for some string $s\\in L(G)$.\n",
    "\t- A lot of ways to solve it.\n",
    "\t- Most direct method is to rewrite grammar unambiguously.\n",
    "\t- Like, enforces precedence of * over +.\n",
    "\t- Impossible to convert **automatically** an ambiguous grammar to an unambiguous one.\n",
    "\t- Most tools allow precedence and associativity declarations to disambiguate grammars.\n",
