# Tutorial for Stanford CS143 Compilers by Alex Aiken

## Introduction

- Course: [**Stanford Online Compilers (self-paced)**](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/Engineering/Compilers/Fall2014/courseware)
  - The course is Stanford CS143 Compilers, **Spring 2014**. The course in the latest season ([Spring, 2016](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)) is not open for non-enrolling students. But you can access some useful materials.
  - You can eroll in the course at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/compilers), too.
  - If you get stuck, you can find more discussion posts in Coursera than in Stanford Online.
