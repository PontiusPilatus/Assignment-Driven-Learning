    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generating code for a stack machine with the accumulator. Run the code on a real machine, e.g., the MIPS processor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Concept**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The accumulator is kept in MIPS register `$a0`.\n",
    "- Keeps the stack in memory.\n",
    "- The address of the next location on the stack is kept in MIPS register `$sp`\n",
    "    - The top of the stack is at address `$sp + 4`\n",
    "\n",
    "### MIPS\n",
    "\n",
    "We will compile the source code from Cool to MIPS assembly to execute it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MIPS**\n",
    "\n",
    "- RISC\n",
    "- Operation uses registers for operands and results.\n",
    "- Use `load` and `store` instructions to manipulate the value in memory.\n",
    "- 32 general purpose registers x 32bits per register\n",
    "\n",
    "**MIPS Instruction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lw reg_1 offset(reg_2)`: Load 32-bit word in address `reg_2 + offset` into register `reg_1`\n",
    "- `sw reg_1 offset(reg_2)`: Store 32-bit word in register `reg_1` into address `reg_2 + offset`\n",
    "- `add reg_tar reg_src reg_src2`\n",
    "- `addiu reg_tar reg_src imm`: `reg_tar = reg_src + imm` (`u` means overflow is not checked.)\n",
    "- `li reg imm`: `reg = imm`\n",
    "- `beq reg1 reg2 label`: If `reg1 = reg2`, then jump to label.\n",
    "- `b label`: Jump to label.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sample** for `7+5`\n",
    "\n",

    "acc <- acc + top_of_stack\n",
    "\n",

    "addiu $sp $sp 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works**\n",
    "\n",
    "For expression `e`, generate MIPS code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compute the value of `e` in `$a0`\n",
    "- Preserve `$sp` and the contents of the stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a code generation function `cgen(e)` whose result is the code generated for `e`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in source\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cgen(e1 + e2) =\n",
    "cgen(e1)\n",
    "print \"sw $a0 0($sp)\"\n",
    "print \"addiu $sp $sp -4\"\n",
    "cgen(e2)\n",
    "print \"lw $t1 4($sp)\"\n",
    "print \"add $a0 $t1 $a0\"\n",
    "print \"addiu $sp $sp 4\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before entering the another cgen function, you should not save anything in the temporal register. Because the temporal register may be used after. Just use the stack machine.\n",
    "- Stack machine code generation is recursive.\n",
    "- Code generation can be written as a recursive-descent of the AST.\n",
    "- In different language, code for function calls and function definitions depends on the layout of the AR.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple AR for Cool**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The result is always in the accumulator.\n",
    "- The activation record holds actual parameters.\n",
    "- The stack discipline guarantees that on function exit `$sp` is the same as it was on function entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On function exit**\n",
    "\n",
    "- We need the return address to jump back.\n",
    "- A pointer to the current activation is useful.\n",
    "- This pointer lives in register `$fp` (frame pointer)\n",
    "- When entering a call to `f(x,y)` the AR of f will be pushed into the stack:\n",
    "    - old fp\n",
    "    - y\n",
    "    - x\n",
    "    - Return Address\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do we manage the variable's location**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Because the stack grows when intermediate results are saved, the variables are not at a fixed offset from `$sp`\n",
    "- **Solution**\n",
    "    - Tutor: use a frame pointer\n",
    "    - I use another stack in code gen to save and search the variables in the stack.\n",
    "        - load from `$sp + (Stack_Size - Variable_Index)`\n",
    "- The activation record must be designed together with the code generator\n",
    "- Code generation can be done by recursive traversal of the AST\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporaries\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we estimate the stack's size?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let `NT(e)` = # of temps needed to evaluate the expression `e`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `NT(e1 + e2)`\n",
    "    - Needs at least as many temporaries as `NT(e1)`\n",
    "    - Needs at least as many temporaries as `NT(e2) + 1`\n",
    "    - Space used for temporaries in `e1` can be reused for temporaries in `e2`\n",
    "    - `NT(e1 + e2) = max(NT(e1), 1 + NT(e2))`\n",
    "- `NT(e1 - e2) = max(NT(e1), 1 + NT(e2))`\n",
    "- `NT(if e1 = e2 then e3 else e4) = max(NT(e1),1 + NT(e2), NT(e3), NT(e4))`\n",
    "- `NT(id(e1,...,en) = max(NT(e1),...,NT(en))`\n",
    "- `NT(int) = 0`\n",
    "- `NT(id) = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "For a function definition `f(x1,...,xn) = e` the AR has `2 + n + NT(e)` elements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return Address `$ra`\n",
    "- Frame Pointer `$fp`\n",
    "- n arguments\n",
    "- `NT(e)` locations for intermediate results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tempories in AR**\n",
    "\n",
    "- old fp\n",
    "- xn\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- x1\n",
    "- RA\n",
    "- Temp NT(e)\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- Temp 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remarks**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code generation must know how many temporaries are in use at each point\n",
    "- Add a new argument to code generation\n",
    "- the position of the next available temporary\n",
    "- The temporary area is used like a small, fixed-size stack\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic**\n",
    "\n",
    "- OO implementation = Basic code generation + More stuff\n",
    "- If B inherits A, code in class A works unmodified for an object of class B\n",
    "- Each attribute stored at a fixed offset in the object\n",
    "- The attribute is in the same place in every object of that class and inherited classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Object Layout**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Offset +0: Class Tag (Int)\n",
    "- Offset +4: Object Size (Int)\n",

    "- Offset +12, 16, ...: Pointer to Attribute (Address)\n",
    "    - If C inherits B and B inherits A, then the sequence is A's attributes, B's attributes, and C's attributes.\n",
