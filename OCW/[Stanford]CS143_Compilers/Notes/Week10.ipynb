    "# Week 10: Java\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cool + \n",
    "\t- Exception\n",
    "\t- Interfaces\n",
    "\t- Threads\n",
    "\t- Dynamic Loading\n",
    "\t- ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "- If B inherits A\n",
    "\t- `B[] b = new B[10]; A[] a = b; a[0] = new A; b[0].method()`\n",
    "\t- Having multiple aliases to updateable locations with different types is unsound!\n",
    "\t- Standard solution: Disallow subtyping through arrays\n",
    "\t\t- B[] < A[] if B = A\n",
    "- Java fixes the problem by checking each array assignment at runtime for type correctness\n",
    "\t- Adds overhead on array computations\n",
    "\t- arrays of primitive types unaffected\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exceptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you encounter an unexpected error, what will you do?\n",
    "\t- Out of memory\n",
    "\t- A list that is supposed to be sorted is not\n",
    "- Solution\n",
    "\t- Add a new type (class) of exceptions\n",
    "\t- Add new forms\n",
    "\t\t- `try{ ... } catch(x) { cleanup }`\n",
    "\t\t- `throw exception`\n",
    "- When we encounter a try\n",
    "\t- Mark current location in the stack\n",
    "- When we throw an exception\n",
    "\t- Unwind the stack to the first try\n",
    "\t- Execute corresponding catch\n",
    "- What happens to an uncaught exception thrown during object finalization?\n",
    "\t- No one catches it.\n",
    "- Methods must declare types of exceptions they may raise: `public void X() throws MyException`\n",
    "\t- Checked at compile time\n",
    "\t- Some exceptions need not be part of the method signature\n",
    "\t\t- dereferencing null\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java programs can use interfaces to make it unnecessary for related classes to share a common abstract superclass or to add methods to Object.\n",
    "- Methods in classes implementing interfaces need not be at fixed offsets.\n",
    "- Dispatches e.f(...) where e has an interface type are more complex than usual\n",
    "\t- Because methods don’t live at fixed offsets\n",
    "- One approach\n",
    "\t- Each class implementing an interface has a lookup table from method names to methods\n",
    "\t- Hash method names for faster lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coercions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java allows primitive types to be coerced in certain contexts.\n",
    "- In `1 + 2.0`, the `int 1` is widened to a `float 1.0`\n",
    "- A coercion is really just a primitive function the compiler inserts for you\n",
    "- Java distinguishes two kinds of coercions & casts\n",
    "\t- Widening: always succeed (int -> float)\n",
    "\t- Narrowing may fail if data can’t be converted to desired type (float -> int, downcasts)\n",
    "- Narrowing casts must be explicit\n",
    "- Wideningcasts / coercions can be implicit\n",
    "- **Bool** is the only type in Java for which there are no coercions/casts defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java has concurrency built in through **threads**\n",
    "- Thread objects have class `Thread`\n",
    "\t- `Start` and `stop` methods\n",
    "- Synchronization obtains a lock on the object: `synchronized (x) { e }` (`lock x; e; unlock x;`)\n",
    "- In synchronized methods, `this` is locked\n",
    "- Even without synchronization, a variable should only hold values written by some thread\n",
    "\t- Writes of values are atomic\n",
    "\t- Violated for doubles (because double needs two words)\n",
    "- Java concurrency semantics are difficult to understand in detail, particularly as to how they might be implemented on certain machines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other Topics\n",
    "\n",
    "- Java allows classes to be loaded at run time\n",
    "\t- Type checking source takes place at compile time\n",
    "\t- Bytecode verification takes place at run time\n",
    "- Loading policies handle by a **ClassLoader**\n",
    "- Classes may also be unloaded\n",
    "- A class is initialized when a symbol in the class is first used\n",
    "\t- **Not** when the class is loaded\n",
    "\t- Delays initialization errors to a predictable point (when something in the class is referenced)\n",
    "- Algo\n",
    "\t1. Lock the class object for the class\n",
    "\t2. If the same thread is already initializing this class, release lock and return\n",
    "\t3. If class already initialized, return normally\n",
    "\t4. Otherwise, mark initialization as in progress by this thread and unlock class\n",
    "\t5. Initialize superclass, fields (in textual order)\n",
    "\t\t- But initialize static, final fields first\n",
    "\t\t- Give every field a default value before initialization\n",
    "\t6. Any errors result in an incorrectly initialized class, mark class as erroneous\n",
    "\t7. If no errors, lock class, label class as initialized, notify threads waiting on class object, unlock class"
